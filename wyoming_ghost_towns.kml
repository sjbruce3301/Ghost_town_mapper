            <name>Atlantic City</name>
            <description>Atlantic City is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fremont County, Wyoming, United States. Founded in 1868 by Tozier, Collins &amp; Thompson with the discovery of the Atlantic Lode. By 1870, the town supposedly attained a population of 2,000. This, as in the case of South Pass City, was probably an exaggeration. The 1870 census only reflected a population of 321 whites and 4 blacks. The population was 39 at the 2000 census. The community is a small mining settlement in a gulch near South Pass in southwestern Wyoming. The town declined following the end of the placer gold rush in the early 1870s, but continued to exist as advances in mining technology allowed further extraction of gold. From the 1960s until 1983, it was the location of US Steel iron ore mine.</description>

            <description>Gebo is a ghost town located in Hot Springs County in the U.S. state of Wyoming. It is located about 11 miles (18 km) north of Thermopolis. The town was established as a coal mining camp in 1907 alongside the nearby camps of Crosby and Kirby. It was named after Samuel Gebo who established the Owl Creek Coal Company and the first mine in the area. Mining remained active until 1938. At its height, over 2000 people lived in the area, mostly miners and their families, making Gebo briefly the largest town in the county. The remains of the town were bulldozed in 1971, though some buildings and the cemetery remain.</description>

            <description>Kane is a town that existed two miles south of the confluence of the Shoshone River and the Bighorn River in Big Horn County, Wyoming. Prior to the completion of the Yellowtail Dam in Montana, the residents of Kane sold their homes and land to the federal government. When the dam was completed the area surrounding Kane was flooded. Kane Cemetery, which is located one mile north of the confluence and is now part of Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area, still exists. Relatives of people buried in the cemetery may continue to be buried there. Although the idea somehow gained currency that the cemetery and its residents were relocated prior to the impoundment of water behind the dam, this is incorrect.</description>

            <description>Lost Springs was first inhabited in the 1880s, when it received its name from railroad workers who could not find the springs shown on survey maps of the area.  The town was incorporated in 1911, and it originally had 200 residents, most of whom worked at the nearby Rosin coal mine. After the coal mine closed around 1930, the population of Lost Springs steadily declined. By 1960, the population of the town had dropped to 5.  In 1976, both the state of Wyoming and the U.S. Bicentennial Commission designated Lost Springs as the smallest incorporated town in America; its population was then 11.</description>
